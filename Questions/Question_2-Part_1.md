CHALLENGE QUESTION 2: THE 2/22 PROMOTION
Difficulty: Intermediate
A marketing manager devised the “2/22” promotion, in which orders subtotaling at
least $2,000 ship for $0.22. The strategy assumes that freight losses will be offset
by gains from higher value orders. According to the marketing manager, orders
between $1,700 and $2,000 will likely boost to $2,000 as customers feel
compelled to take advantage of bargain freight pricing.
You are asked to test the 2/22 promotion for hypothetical profitability based on the
marketing manager’s assumption about customer behavior. Examine orders
shipped to California during fiscal year 2008 for net gains or losses under the
promotion.
PART I
Create a table that includes the following columns:
SalesOrderID
Ship to state (California)
OrderDate
Historical order subtotal (prior to any changes as a result of the
promotion)
Historical freight (prior to any changes as a result of the promotion)
Potential promotional effect. Indicate one of three hypothetical scenarios
related to the order:
Increase order to $2,000 and pay $0.22 freight
No order change and pay $0.22 freight
No order change and pay historical freight
Potential order gain
Potential freight loss
Potential promotional net gain/loss
